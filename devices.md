# **Clouds, Services, and Servers**


##  **What can they do?**
- Cloud computing services provide users with different computer resources, with storage and computing power being the most popular options. Current popular cloud computing options include a wide array of services from AWS or Azure, ranging from EC2 where clients can rent a virtual machine to run as server for their applications, to more recent technologies like Rekognition which provides image recognition services.

- Cloud services can be categorized into [three groups][1]:
    1. *Software as a Service (SaaS)*: is a model in which software providers host their applications and make them available to users on the Internet. A few popular examples are Google's G Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, ...), DropBox, ...

    1. *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*: 

    1. *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*:

The main difference between these three cloud computing models is in what component you can control, illustrated by the following figure.

- Compared to traditional dedicated servers, cloud storage does not require users to have physical storage server. By using cloud storage, users only need to pay for operational cost for the storage they need instead of having physical storage space where they also need to account for storage space growth. Current popular cloud storage options include AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, ...

### *State-of-the-art*
- The current state-of-the-art

### *What can be done now?*
- Cloud services providers are currently offering a wide array of services: from business applications (AWS Chime, WorkMail, ...) to analytics services (AWS Athena, Kinesis, CloudSearch, ...), and even more recent techonologies like AR/VR (AWS Sumerian). If you can think of a service, that service is likely already offered.

### *What is likely to be done soon?*
- The industry is currently focused on making green technologies, and cloud computing is not an outlier. Researches are being conducted on designing efficient data storage centers, by either coming up with more efficient resource pooling methods, or by lowering devices' power consumption rate.

### *Technological developments*
- At the moment, most of cloud computing services require interaction with the resources on the 'cloud' via internet connection. With upcoming 5G technologies significantly improves data transfer speed, improvement in streaming technologies and platforms is only to be expected.

## **How this will affect me**

### *Daily life*

- Personally, I take great advantage of free storage offered by Google Drive. Having cloud storage space means I can work on personal projects from multiple computers and not worry about carrying physical storage devices to access those files.

- For my education, having a GitHub account is extremely convenient. GitHub is a cloud-based source code management service, which falls into the SaaS category of cloud computing. With GitHub to manage projects' version, I can easily roll back to a previous version if my update breaks the project, or decide whether to merge a certain branch or feature into my project.
