    <h3>Team profile: GROUP 1</h3>

    <h4>Personal Information</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tran Minh Duc (s3855825):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He was born in Hanoi. He is more likely a patient and calm person based on his look. He does not talk a lot,
            however,
            he is still friendly and approachable. It’s just because he usually prefers to be alone to focus easily on
            his
            work.
            Duc
            found his interest in IT ever since he was in secondary school. Specifically, during the first time he was
            introduced to Pascal, he began to like it. However, it was until he was in the second year of his high
            school
            that
            he began to learn programming. His first project was a Tic-tac-toe game that competed with AI, but he didn’t
            know
            how to make the GUI at that time so he still has a long way to go, since study is a whole life journey.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Nguyen Vinh Quang (s3817788):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He was born on 23th June, 2000 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. He is also at times called Edward, or simply
            just
            Ed.
            Quang is keen on playing sports, reading science books, and playing games with his friends during his
            past-time.
            Ever since he was in secondary school, he has read research relating to science. However, it was after he
            finished
            his presentation about ASIMO robots that sparked his interest in the IT field, to be more specific, it was
            about
            AI
            (Artificial Intelligence). Still, at the moment, he has a long way to go and there are many things he has to
            learn
            before realizing his true path.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ngo Nhat Minh (s3838104):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minh was born on 21st September, 2001 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Sometimes he is misclaimed as an Indian
            due
            to
            his look, however, he is 100% Vietnamese. Minh is keen on playing video games and sports, hanging out with
            his
            friends and chit-chatting. The most interesting thing about him is he’s the only one vegan in the team, but,
            he
            is
            also the biggest and tallest in the team. He found his interest in IT when he was in the first grade of high
            school.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Nguyen Hung Vinh (s3778972):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He was born on 3rd August, 1999 in Can Tho city, Vietnam. He’s also called Arno once in a while, but still,
            mostly
            is Vinh. He’s the eldest and also the most introverted guy of the team. Playing games, especially MOBA games
            and
            reading books are his favorite hobbies. Due to being an introverted person so he’s usually shy to make new
            friends,
            even though he loves it. The first time that he found his interest in IT was when he was in high school.
            During
            that
            time, he has already done some small research about IT fields and was totally struck by them. Later on, he
            has
            also
            realized that he had the ability to do problem solving and get on well with algorithms, and ever since then,
            he
            made
            up his mind to choose to be a Back-End developer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Team Profile</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Minh Duc</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Test 1 – Learning Style Test:
            Based on this test, Duc is a visual learner, which means he tends to remember things by reading and/or
            seeing
            the
            pictures. He has the ability to imagine and brings everything that he’s learning into his visual picture in
            his
            mind. In addition, he also doesn’t like to study in a crowded or noisy place, where he can be distracted
            easily
            by
            the background noises.</li>
          <li>
            Test 2 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
            He tends to be an introverted person who would always rather work behind the scene than taking the
            spotlight.
            Moreover, he considers himself as a “fixer”, which means he is able to handle problems related to his team’s
            work
            whenever it comes up.</li>
          <li>
            Test 3 – Colour Personality Test:
            There’s nothing much to say about the result of this test since it’s similar to the Myer Briggs test above.
            As
            mentioned, Duc tends to work individually in order to push himself to work as best as he can. On the other
            hand,
            it
            recommends him for being patient and kind towards everyone, and luckily, he already got all of them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Vinh Quang</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
            According to this test and based on the team’s opinion, Quang truly is an extroverted, who has the ability
            to
            link
            his teammates together and form the bonds between them. He is the one and only perfectionist in this team
            because he
            wants everything he does to be nearly, or even perfect. However, fortunately, he is lazy every once in a
            while,
            and
            thereby, it somehow helps him to not push himself over his limit.</li>
          <li>Test 2 – Learning Style Test:
            Quang and Duc share the same learning style, which means they both good at visualizing things that they have
            learned
            and picturing them in their head. Quang also is easily got distracted by noise. In contrast, he loves to
            work in
            pairs or groups because he wants to get to know others’ point of view and willing to help each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Nhat Minh</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:
            Based on the results, Minh somehow is an extroverted, which is totally adverse to his expectation that he is
            an
            introverted due to his disapproval in social interactions. He is more likely a logistic type rather than the
            emotional one.</li>
          <li>Test 2 – Learning Style Test:
            Minh’s learning style mostly is auditory, which means he can learn effectively by hearing. His ideal study
            environment is classroom, where he can have the ability to comprehend, analyses the lecture and retain the
            information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hung Vinh</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>Myer Briggs Personality Test:
            The test results reflect nearly 90% accuracy about his character that he’s more likely an introverted, but
            also
            sometimes he could be an extroverted because still loves to make friends and widen his social relationship.
            He
            focuses on the team’s or social’s harmony, balancing the connection between the participants rather than
            competing.
            Even though he is not creative most of the time, he still can be able to support the team’s idea and at
            times
            giving
            the contrast idea in order to make it more reasonable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="industry-data" class="tabcontent">
    <ul>
      <li>Judging from the database shown by the given diagram; it can be seen here that SQL; a special-purpose
        programming language designed to handle data in a relational database management system has remained consistent
        as the leading demand of IT skill throughout these particular time periods. Moreover, a text-based programming
        language such as JavaScript additionally allows both the client-side and server-side to make web pages
        interactive. With all of these specific IT skills mentioned; fortunately, all the personally favored jobs above
        fit in perfectly with these requirements.</li>

      <li>From the information displayed and provided by Burning Glass, without a doubt; Communication skills has won
        favoritism in being the number required baseline skills set along with Problem Solving, Organizational Skills,
        Writing and Teamwork/Collaboration. All of which slots in cleanly with the demanded skills in the listed
        occupations above, further solidifying the importance of improving said skills. </li>

      <li>Microsoft Windows: broadly known as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system
        families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. It can be said here that, all the three
        aforementioned career paths above do not necessarily revolve around this system as they tend to be more
        obligated
        to be focused on other aspects of their jobs such as coding, analytical problem-solving, researching and more.
      </li>

      <li>Microsoft C#: is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft that aims to achieve the combination
        of
        the computing power of C++ and the programming ease of Visual Basic. Likewise, It is an absence feature that all
        the occupations written above shared in common and held a fewer or lesser importance.</li>

      <li>Oracle: being a multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle, it is commonly used
        for
        running online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing (DW) and mixed (OLTP & DW) database workloads.
        Similar to the other two factors; there are other alternatives preferred or used instead of this, for instance
        Java along with SQL.</li>

      <li>Mentoring: In normal circumstances; people who have chosen and walked the career path of IT would not
        necessarily
        need further teaching, as most of the important knowledge would have been learnt and taught during their
        university years. Not to mention, self-study and research can be made easily done individually regarding any
        possible lingering questions, therefore it is safe to say that this skill isn’t quite a necessity as it is
        unlike
        for collaboration and communication skills.</li>

      <li>Presentation Skills: Similar to the previously mentioned requirements, this one is not particularly needed
        either
        as most projects are either done in teams which only need in-group discussion or workload that requires only one
        person.</li>

      <li>Management: Regarding the three specific occupations, management does not seem to be the main focal point of
        the
        job, rather they each have their own tasks to do that may overlap with analytical thinking together with working
        in teams but not much to the point of managing the whole process on their own.</li>

      <li>Despite after seeing the charts given by Burning Glass, we have simultaneously come into a collaborative
        agreement
        in which none of our favored occupations currently in mind have been changed. In our most humble opinions,
        staying
        faithful with the decision you have made along with working hard in regards to improving your skills is better
        than constantly changing your ideal job in order to adapt with the ever-changing demands. This can be applied
        beyond job selection as it can be proven in normal everyday life, as there are plenty of things you can’t
        control
        in life; such as the people around you together with what society requires from you. Yet that doesn’t mean
        you’ll
        have to follow every single one of them, the choice you made will pave a way to a future in which you have hoped
        and planned for. Personally, it’s preferable to live life the way you want to in contrast to the mindset to
        continuously follow every new trend, therefore it is why our group members have ultimately stayed with our
        selected career for now; as possible occurrences in the future including family and personal issues may hinder
        with the chosen path.</li>

  <div id="transcript" class="tabcontent">
    <em>In this transcript, “I” will refer to the IT professional we interviewed. This transcript is a summarized
      version
      of our interview. The full version can be found here.</em>
    <h4>Please tell me about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h4>
    <p>I am currently working at a company that does outsourcing services, and we have a lot of customers all over the
      world, and in various industries. Currently, I am working on a project to develop a platform for an oil and gas
      customer to monitor their oil wells and to process the performance data from machineries using machine learning
      algorithms.</p>
    <h4>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
    <p>Machine learning is a relatively new trend in the IT industry. I work with machine learning models, mostly to
      predict a trend in the amount of oil harvested the next few months from customers’ tabular data. There are many
      other applications of machine learning as well, such as interpreting human language or object detection, object
      tracking, … like human can.</p>
    <h4>What kind of work do you have to do?</h4>
    <p>Other than the machine learning kind of work, I also work with backend systems which contain databases and
      functions to process and aggregate them, create API (help users interact with backend systems or our machine
      learning model). I also build message brokers to transfer data from the database to the user's interface.</p>
    <h4>Who are all the people you interact with at work? Please tell us about them.</h4>
    <p>There are business analysts who work with clients to gather requirements, and finally come up with specific
      requirements of the IT service. There are also solution architects who will design and set the platform and all
      the structure for the whole project. Solution architects are developers who are experienced in multiple languages
      and technologies, and they know what kind of product or services will be needed for the final product/solution.
      And of course there are developers who will implement the solution and create the final product. Finally, there is
      the quality assurance team, who will test to see if our models produce desired results, or if there’s any problem
      with the product. </p>
    <h4>Please tell us about your interaction with other IT professionals</h4>
    <p>My team works on the latest and most updated technologies and we provide digital consulting for customers. There
      are two smaller “subteams”, which are the solution architects and the AI engineers, each handling different kinds
      of jobs. The architects are involved in enterprise projects and also projects from the AI team. They assist with
      coming up with solutions and platforms for the final product. The other team, which is an AI team, focuses on
      machine learning models and related technologies. There is also a research team, who write scientific reports and
      journals and “deep dive” into the latest development in the field.</p>
    <h4>What about interactions with clients or investors?</h4>
    <p>My company, FPT Software, is a joint stock company and is already established on the stock exchange, so only the
      top executives will interact with investors.</p>
    <p>I sometimes directly interact with clients. Sometimes they are product owners, or quality assurance teams, and my
      job is to make sure we agree on the requirements. For example, earlier this year, I actually went to the US to
      work directly with the customer to clarify all the difficult points in the requirements to speed up the project.
    </p>
    <h4>What aspect of work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4>
    <p>For me, most of the time I spend on implementing solutions given by the SA team. Since I work with quite a lot of
      different technologies, I would need to spend a lot of time studying those technologies before I can implement the
      solution.</p>
    <h4>What aspect of work do you find most challenging?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging for me is to keep up to date with new technologies. In this industry, everything is changing
      really fast so one technology may get outdated in just one or two years. Sometimes, we may even need to find an
      entirely different platform to maintain a project.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="small-devices" class="tabcontent">
    <h4>What can they do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud computing services provide users with different computer resources, with storage and computing power
        being
        the most popular options. Current popular cloud computing options include a wide array of services from AWS or
        Azure, ranging from EC2 where clients can rent a virtual machine to run as server for their applications, to
        more
        recent technologies like Rekognition which provides image recognition services.</li>

      <li>Cloud services can be categorized into three groups:
        <ol>
          <li>Software as a Service (SaaS): is a model in which software providers host their applications and make them
            available to users on the Internet. A few popular examples are Google's G Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, ...),
            DropBox, AWS S3 ...</li>
          <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS): is a model where you, as users, can host your applications without the need
            for
            dedicated infrastructure (servers and storages), which will be provided by PaaS service providers. Customers
            do
            not have control over the provided infrastructure or platform, only their applications. In this model, users
            develop their software, and deploy them on cloud platforms. Examples of PaaS include AWS Beanstalk, , ...
          </li>
          <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): is where users are provided with infrastructure (processing power,
            storage, network, ...), which they can 'rent' from service providers. These infrastructures are virtual
            machines
            (similar to what Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare offers) with customizable components (users can select how much
            resource they requires for their infrastructure, e.g. how much RAM they need, ...) and they can be
            customized
            and accessed remotely to create users' own IT platform. The biggest IaaS services offered include AWS EC2,
            ..
          </li>
        </ol>

        The main difference between these three cloud computing models is in what component you can control, illustrated
        by
        the following figure.<br><br>
        <img src="https://blogs.bmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-810x754.png" />
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>Compared to traditional dedicated servers, cloud storage does not require users to have a physical storage
        server.
        By using cloud storage, users only need to pay for operational costs for the storage they need instead of having
        physical storage space where they also need to account for storage space growth. Current popular cloud storage
        options include AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, …</li>
      <li>>Cloud services providers are currently offering a wide array of services: from business applications (AWS
        Chime,
        WorkMail, ...) to analytics services (AWS Athena, Kinesis, CloudSearch, ...), and even more recent technologies
        like
        AR/VR (AWS Sumerian). If you can think of a service, that service is likely already offered.</li>
      <li>The industry is currently focused on making green technologies, and cloud computing is not an outlier.
        Research is
        being conducted on designing efficient data storage centers, by either coming up with more efficient resource
        pooling methods, or by lowering devices' power consumption rate.</li>
      <li>>According to this article, most of the current trend focuses on public adoption of cloud computing.
        Especially
        with the current pandemic situation, as people working remotely is becoming more common, cloud computing
        adoption
        rate is only expected to keep growing, with relational databases-as-a-service at 63% adoption rate. Certainly we
        can
        expect a lot more focused development in this area, with services like Amazon DynamoDB getting more features
        with
        better support and storage fee.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Impacts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Since cloud computing services remove the need for physical infrastructure, they have a great impact upon
        traditional IT resources. Furthermore, it also makes data synchronization across multiple devices simple and
        easy to
        automate. This results in a push for office workers to continue their work communication and sometimes even
        their
        duties after working hours, away from their office by using applications like Google G Suite.</li>
      <li>We can also see the impact on smaller computing devices. With cloud storage services effectively reducing the
        need
        for physical storage, we should see a trend of customers gearing toward devices with smaller storage capacity
        which
        cost less. However, due to security concerns, people are discouraged from moving to cloud storage.</li>
      <li>Security is still a great concern when it comes to using cloud storage. Over the last 10 years, there were
        various
        breaches in security, resulting in leaks of personal information and data from some of the largest cloud storage
        services. The most high-profiled victims of these breaches are Apple's iCloud, DropBox, ... Data of millions of
        users are stolen, suggesting there should be a change in how large cloud storage providers approach security and
        protecting customers' data.</li>
      <li>Along with security, privacy of data is also of concern when it comes to using cloud storage. While using
        private
        cloud storage services may protect users' data from government surveillance, it does not mean the data is
        completely
        private as it can be used for analytics by storage service providers or even sold to third parties.</li>

    <h4>What is Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies?</h4>
    <p>Blockchain technology is known as the digital ledger recording data of all of the network transactions. These
      data are stored in “blocks” of information that are unalterable, cannot be hacked or cheated, protected by
      encrypted keys by using a hash function. Once a new transaction occurs, a new block of transaction will be added
      into the system for every participant. The data of the blocks mostly are time and transaction data, dollar amount,
      etc. As the data is approved and published, it is unchangeable. Blockchain is a decentralized distribution
      database, which means participants are permitted to access the database simultaneously without being put in the
      waitlist. One closet application for Blockchain is for the cryptocurrency which cannot be manipulated by any
      agencies. Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum and DigiByte, are virtual currencies with an impossibility to be faked
      or double-spend. The word crypto means encryption algorithms and hashing values which are unable to access or
      extract if we do not have a private key.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bank Remittance:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One of the most logical uses of Blockchain is being used as a means of cash transferring from one person’s /
          party’s fund to another’s. It is believed that there’s no other industry reap benefits from blockchain for its
          commercial activities than banking. It can be clearly seen that the institutions of the banking industry only
          work during business hours, 5 days per week, which means if an individual or a party wants to make a
          transaction on weekends, they have to wait until next Monday for money transferred into their account. In
          order to handle that issue, Blockchain can be a leverage for banking transactions. More specifically, by using
          Blockchain, the process of money transaction only occurs as around 10 minutes, </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Healthcare industry:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Healthcare services are more likely to be integrated into Blockchain technology owing to its high-techno
          security system. As mentioned above, data is encrypted by using a hash function before being stored in the
          “block” database. Similarly, Blockchain can also store the information of medical records so as to avoid
          drug counterfeiting. To be more specific, these medical records could be encoded and stored on the
          Blockchain database once they are licensed and signed, the information of the records will be written into
          the database, and therefore, it can provide confidence and assurance toward the patients about the drug's
          authenticity. </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Smart contract:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As far as we know, Bitcoin has formed a bedrock for integrating Smart contracts into Blockchain due to its
          transparency, accuracy and convenience. However, with the advent of Ethereum and Ethereum Smart Contract,
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is likely to be able to be done soon (in the next 3 years)?</h4>
    <p>As Blockchain has become well-known day by day, experts and scientists are trying to implement the technology of
      Blockchain into more areas. One of the most feasible utilizations of this mean of technology is for Voting.
      Elections are a symbol of hope and freedom, and the right to vote is an expression of belonging and of having a
      voice. With the method of using the security system of the Blockchain database, it can help voters to eliminate
      voting fraud, as well as secure their data. To be more detail, each vote will be stored on the block of
      information which is nearly cannot be tampered with. Last but not least, the voting results will be officially
      provided nearly instant owing to the Blockchain technology.</p>
    <h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
    <p>Unlike centralized databases owned by the government or a company which is more likely to be a target for
      hackers,
      Blockchain is not under any individual control. The data is distributed, or duplicated across other participants'
      computers', which means everyone in the transaction can access the database at any time simultaneously as long as
      they own the right key to connect with the blocks. By this way, the blocks are incredibly secured because they are
      mostly invulnerable, which makes them useful for storing and recording transaction data, as well as forming
      transparency and conviction towards the customers.</p>
    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cryptocurrencies are secured systems. Every payment is executed by using the Blockchain. Thereby, in the near
        future, many companies will start using Cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Moreover, they can cut off the
        middleman from various processes. For example, when transferring money from two different companies. The
        middleman
        is the bank which will cost some fee based on the amount of money. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the
        cost will be reduced. Plus, no one can make a change or take out the money that is put in the blockchains.
        Therefore, Cryptocurrencies are chosen for the future, when it is not only cheaper and faster but also more
        protected than the traditional way.</li>
      <li>The business world will be the aspect that affected the most. This alternative shift could change the ways
        people
        interact with each other. The first field that would be disadvantaged is banking. Because Cryptocurrencies is a
        peer-to-peer transfer which means there are no intermediary agencies, all the banking industry will be paralyze.
        Most of the money in banking comes from various service fees. Hence, when the cryptocurrencies are common, they
        will be the first victim to be collapsed. Secondly, many brokerages will also make money off and be useless. In
        the investing world, banks are not the only middleman, brokerages are also taking commissions by transactions.
        Their functions are bringing buyers and sellers together and helping them and take money from these processes.
        When Bitcoin and others engage in the market, brokerages need to change the way to adapt with the new way of
        investment.</li>

    <h4>About cybersec</h4>
    <p>Cyber Security, as its core definition, is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices,
      electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. In other words, an information technology security
      or electronic information security which terms applied in various other contexts such as from business to mobile
      computing. Regarding the highest level of general development of this new technology, one of its many uses is
      heavily known for Network Security; a process of protecting the network from any unwanted intruders, whether that
      be targeted users or opportunistic intrusions and malware. Secondly, Application Security which mainly focuses on
      constant updates and testing in order to ensure safety to these programs, along with keeping these software and
      devices free of threats. Third, Information Security; the act of securing the integrity together with privacy of
      one’s data, either in storage or in transit, especially data inside of networks and applications whilst also
      sheltering company and customer information in a separate layer. Moreover, Cyber security also provides mobile
      security which as the name suggests; helps cell phones and tablets alike to virtually be involved in all types of
      security. Fourth, Cyber Security in addition to including the processes and decisions for handling and protecting
      data assets also aids permission users to have them whenever accessing a network. Furthermore, where or how the
      data may be stored or shared all fall under this category of Operational Security as well. Additionally, it could
      be seen providing disaster recovery and business continuity if in case such misfortune would do so to arrive,
      after all it dictates how an organization were to restore its loss of operations or data from the possible Cyber
      Threats. </p>
    <p>It is crucial to note here that the End-user education in which details in addressing the most unpredictable
      Cyber Security factor; is people, considering it is very much a built in mechanic that humans make mistakes, it
      wouldn’t be farfetched for anyone to accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise protected system due to
      failure of following basic security practices. This is why it is advised for users to delete suspicious email
      attachments or checking in unsecure websites, avoid plugging in unidentified USB Drivers, and many other vital
      necessities that serve crucial in depending the system from the likes of any accidental viruses or possibly
      harmful threats.</p>
    <p>Moving on into the hypothetical future of what is plausibly able to be done soon, with the ever-evolving age of
      Cyber Security; it can be rather challenging to predict what may come exactly. Even so, experts did manage to
      grasp a good concept of the general direction in which this new technology is heading forth to, say for instance;
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming the core component of all cybersecurity systems. It is without a doubt
      truthful that as each passing day goes by, more and more development will keep nourishing in this modern age where
      mankind keeps on improving their own creation even further. Thus, it isn’t unlikely for AI’s potential to be used
      in both the good and bad ways; for examples, elusive hackers may target these powers in hopes of meaning more
      harms whereas upcoming developers ought to harness this advanced material in means of detecting security issues,
      addressing vulnerabilities before they can be taken advantage of along with repelling Cyber Attacks once they have
      begun. Taking into account a study carried out by Michel Cukier, a University of Maryland researcher, it has been
      proven that hacks are getting so frequent that they are now happening at an average rate of every 39 seconds, most
      of which were done by tech-savvy people using automated scripts to skim through databases in search for
      vulnerabilities to exploit. This occurrence is possibly due to the growth in developing countries, creating
      massive expansions of the teaching workforce in which case certain areas aren’t capable of giving sufficient jobs
      for trained and well-educated trainers that might cause them to turn to pursuing Cyber Crimes instead.</p>
    <p>Despite well-resourced companies’ best attempts at shielding their valuables with cyber security specialists,
      unfortunately they are still getting hacked on a daily basis which indicates the need for new technology
      advancements due to the current existing one growing old, limited or simply not serving its purpose as well as
      before. The old IT world is coming to a close; diminishing, with every new day comes with new emerging data
      threats, therefore it has undoubtedly evoked the demand for innovation and evolution of defense capabilities to
      secure data integrity in organizations. Several tactics including Context-Aware Behavioral Analytics has been
      updated, or better for a lack of term; utilized into being a better monitor in identifying suspicious transactions
      and behavior with disregard to meaningless security alerts that did not point to any attacks. On top of that,
      “‘zero-day’ exploits” used by hackers to establish a foothold and gather information in systems for several months
      without any notices, will provoke the next generation Breach Detection to improve itself; with combination of
      machinery learning and the behavioral analytics to identify these threats and track them to the source.
      Additionally, slick minded hackers would tend to study a company’s defenses and then send a Trojan horse and
      because of the huge amount of information being handled in companies, it wasn’t easy to know right away about the
      lurking danger causing innovation focusing on what happen once an attack has occurred therefore notifying on the
      breadcrumbs that the hacker leaves behind to be further developed. With many more other impacts likely to be made
      in the future, it is also highly credible for organizations to seek out talented individuals with knowledge of
      developing Cyber Security even more. Once this becomes gravely essential, Cyber Security Students to be required
      in learning and adopting future infrastructures and IT architectures (CSAIL) that will enable you to secure most
      online financial transactions, adding to this; specialist in this field would be welcomed to venture into research
      on coming up with new Cyber Security ideas.</p>
    <p>As technology begins to be more and more important to our daily lives, leading us to become increasingly
      dependent on it due to how much easier it has made our living days, yet it also leaves us vulnerable to risk as
      well since with every ups there will always be a downside to it; that is life in general. With such factors taken
      into account, Cyber security is expected to affect mine and your daily/working lives greatly, especially
      considering how much there is to be offered by them; they are certainly a big deal. Providing a secured networking
      system with a means of ensuring safety to the countless files containing valuable, sensitive data along the lines
      of medical records or business details. Improvement being made to this technology would surely make it even more
      efficient and better at protecting the databases belonging to its respective users, likewise with the numerous
      mentions of its usage in the paragraph above; it is safe to say here that Cyber Security is hugely essential for
      keeping your privacy safe. Not only is Cyber Security evolving but so are Cyber Threats as well, they can cause
      electrical blackouts, failure of military equipment and breaches of national security secrets together with
      disruption of mobile devices, cellular phones, computers, networks or paralyzing systems, causing data to be
      unavailable. Because of this, Cyber Security is at top priority in the networking, businesses frontier along with
      even our casual everyday lives as well. As the future grows closer, it is anticipated for a growth of users;
      friends and families alike to be aware of this in order to be able to use it properly to secure their personal
      information. But this is something humans have learnt to do for the past millennia, with every constant evolution
      comes with changes needed to be adapted; growth is inevitable and is a natural process in life.

    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
    <p>Machine Learning is a subfield of Computer Science and Information Technology and it has thrived in recent years.
      Because many big companies like Apple, Google and Facebook are investing in, a lot of applications using Machine
      Learning have been created. Not only in technology but also in other aspects, such as physics, chemistry, medical
      and politics, this field has made a huge step for them. By using algorithms and given data, machines can
      self-learning and execute complicated tasks without manually programming every step. To be more specific, Machine
      Learning’s process is giving training data to a learning algorithm. Training data needs humans to be involved in
      before giving it to the model to learn. High-quality training data is very important because it is just like a
      book for a “child” which is an algorithm to learn. Therefore, a complicated, accurate, adequate and irrelevant
      training data in the early stages will make the Machine Learning model generate valuable results. A learning
      algorithm can be comprehended as a brain of the system. It uses the provided training data to make a set of rules.
      Because of that, different training data and learning algorithms could generate different models. For example, the
      same type of learning algorithm can teach the system how to translate different languages. In addition, both
      processes of the Machine Learning model are crucial. They are influenced by each other. If the given training data
      is inaccurate or irrelevant, no matter how perfect the learning algorithm is it, it will cause a poor result. On
      the contrary, a substandard algorithm will miss information in given data. </p>

    <p>Thanks to Big Data and Cloud, nowadays, Machine Learning can repeat and generate the system faster. It has a lot
      of applications that have been used around us. The closest one is in social networks and Email. Facebook cannot
      have enough laborers to serve 2.4 billion users a day with their rapidly up-to-date requirements. Machine Learning
      is a vital aspect that helps them to meet with demands of customers. One of the features is “People You May Know”
      which is guessing people that we are familiar with. The ML has used algorithms to analyze our profile, list
      friends, address and other factors to calculate the possible results. Another feature is advertisements we might
      consider by classifying our interest and age. Furthermore, in medical, ML is combined with sensors to evaluate the
      health condition of patients in real-time which assists doctors easier diagnose illness. </p>

    <p>Machine learning is a premise of Artificial Intelligence which is the future of humanity. Currently, the actual
      AI is still out of human technology. When we define an AI, it means a software, a mind, not hardware, a body. It
      should think and respond to events in daily life like humans. Hence, the final purpose of Machine Learning is
      constructing an excellent AI. For the closer purpose is making computers to have simple perceptions of humans. In
      the near future, a computer can become a powerful disability’s assistant that helps work more accessible for
      employees with disabilities. Virtual Reality will be a new environment for them to work. Another application that
      can be real is language models. The translated system at the moment just generates the base meaning of words that
      make some results useless with users. Because the system does not understand the situation of sentences. The
      algorithm for the language model will be developed so that it can understand deeper as humans do. In the near
      future, it might translate a book to a different language but still keep the original ideas of the author.
      Overall, Machine Learning changes our daily life, brings convenience and modernity to every aspect.</p>

    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
    <p>The purpose of technology is to serve our demands. People always try to find a short way to do things so
      programmers and engineers will try their best to develop and create a more effective machine. The way Machine
      Learning impacts our life is becoming an assistant that always executes jobs as high accuracy. Our brain is a huge
      drive that can store 2.5 petabytes of data. However, we cannot remember lots of information at the same time.
      Therefore, the creation of AI has brought an “artificial secretary” to the world. For example, Google Assistant,
      Alexa and Siri are the first pioneers in smart virtual supporters. Moreover, some factories can change to
      industrial automation. It can reprogram industrial PCs and optimize the entire supply chains in the operation. By
      applying this development in all life aspects, there will be two biggest influences in society. The advantage is
      machines will take most of the tasks, users just need to order and wait for the service. For instance, the
      Internet of Things combines with the AI on the phone in order to control every electricity connection with private
      Wi-Fi by our voice which is called smart house. Moreover, factories can reduce manual labor by automatic chains.
      Nevertheless, we might depend on convenience too much and become lazy. A lot of workers will be unemployed because
      their jobs have been taken by machines. To sum up, everything has two sides but we need to keep evolving. Because
      of that, modern will always replace obsolescence to meet with the demand of customers. Instead of having thousands
      of workers, a group of 3 to 4 specialists with technical skills in Machine Learning can operate the whole chain.
    </p>

    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
    <p>As a programmer, we can easily accept this development without hesitation. If we have chosen IT as our path, we
      must determine to learn and approach new information. Technology is always developing, if an IT worker misses off
      the latest “update”, they will fall behind. Because of that, it plays an important role in my career. Machine
      Learning will rapidly grow in the near future and drag along the AI field, other aspects will also be developed to
      contribute to it. Thus, not only ML programmers are effective, but also other minors need to try to catch up. When
      AI has moved closer to perfect which is become an independent artificial brain, our life will be changed in many
      ways. Firstly, we will not need to be concerned about traffic issues. Most vehicles will be autonomous by ML that
      make the statistics of a traffic accident to dropdown. In some accidents, the reflection of humans is not fast
      enough to cause serious crashes. Thanks to accuracy calculation by algorithms, vehicles can impeccably operate
      without any support of users. Secondly, AI with IoT will change the way we live. A house with automatic electronic
      devices will be a dream of all of us when lightbulbs to AC can understand and self-control to satisfy our demand.
      Moreover, it can monitor the user’s health by measuring whether the foods we eat are good for us or if we drink
      enough water. In conclusion, ML to AI is a future of humanity, the better we know about it, the faster we grow.

  <div id="project-idea" class="tabcontent">
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Our project is called the “RMIT student network”. This is a website that all RMIT students can access to form a
      team for assignments and work on with it as a group. The feature is showing students posts as News Feed like
      Facebook. Moreover, each person will have their own biography, previous posts and credit points. Another feature
      is group space for discussion and setting up deadlines. Finally, each member in the group can give comments and
      evaluate by criteria to others. These feedbacks will affect the student's profile and future collaborators will
      use it as a tool to estimate whether that member is appropriate to work with them or not. In addition, this
      website will provide RMIT students an opportunity to form a team with the same goal and exclude inactive people.
    </p>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>There are two reasons that motivate us to do this project. Firstly, some students have a problem with gathering a
      team. RMIT has an international environment with not only teachers but also students from different countries.
      Although English is the primary language at a campus, outside class time, most of the students use their mother
      language. Hence, at the beginning of semester, some people find it difficult to communicate like introverts will
      be separated and must be formed with lazy people who are left behind by lectures. That will be a disadvantage for
      them. They need equipment to represent their personality and other aspects to classmates. Secondly, using the RMIT
      Society group to find a potential teammate is unduly challenging. There are many other kinds of topics in the RMIT
      group, such as accommodation, finding roommates, lost and found. Therefore, it is time-consuming to find the post
      we need. Moreover, not everyone uses Facebook or knows about the group. Hence, it is unfair to that part of
      students. Overall, our project is inspired by understanding the unsolved issues of RMIT students.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This website will be recommended and to all students by RMIT and lectures so that everybody can experience it.
      The front-end of the website will be simple with an appearance like other social media. It will have the search
      bar, other tasks like home, notification, profile button and a list of groups that students currently have with
      chatbox. When new students first use the website, it will have a short guide through all functions. Moreover, we
      will ask RMIT to hold a workshop for teaching people to use the RMIT student network. The website will have three
      mains part:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The home section will show the post that relates to our major. At first contact, the website will ask students
        to
        choose the Schools they are in which is SST, SBM, SCD and SEUP in order to present all the current articles
        related to their major. First of all, instead of posting “status” like other social networks, it will have a
        place
        to the public for a request to form a group for coursework or events. Moreover, not only it displays individual
        posts but also shows the groups’ recruitment for finding other members. Secondly, the web has an announcement
        box
        to show their interaction like how many and who want to collaborate with them.</li>

      <li>The profile section will show the bio of the user. For example, name, date-of-birth, some facts about them and
        their stories. Another part is the credit point and feedback from previous collaborators which will be a tool to
        evaluate students. However, new students can only choose teammates by their bio and each student has the same
        point at the start, 2000. This number will change positively or negatively depending on how they express
        themselves as a team.</li>
      <li>Group chat section will help all members in a group to work professionally. They can set up deadlines and show
        work processes by publishing tasks so that everyone in a group can see and support each other.</li>

      <li>The main function of the RMIT student network is to create a credible and appropriate environment for students
        to
        engage in. Before posting a request, learners will be asked to choose what is their goal in the assignment so
        that
        the web can find results that close with the requirement. For example, a student aiming for HD will be
        recommended
        to another student who also has the same target. However, if a lazy person tries to choose an HD or DI goal in
        order to be a parasite, the credit point and previous evaluation will be a tool to denounce their idleness in
        cooperation. Therefore, if they want to be admitted as an active and effective teammate, they need to try to
        have
        a good profile. Some students are trying to rush through the course and get the degree so they do not really
        care
        about the grade. In this situation, they can freely find a suitable partner who has the same mindset as them.
        Each article will only have two buttons which are contact and enrolment. There will not have a comment section
        in
        another to oblige to interact. An announcement box will show invites from other groups or a person who wants to
        collaborate so that users can consider the group they want to work with.</li>
    </ol>
    In conclusion, the RMIT student network is an alternative method for students to form a team. It will be a
    comprehensive digital workplace for everyone.</p>

    <h4>Tools and Technology</h4>
    <p>It is a website so it such have both versions in computers and smartphones:
      Software: a website with the security of RMIT, an account will be the same as the Canvas. With the phone version,
      it
      can be an application so that it can perform better interaction.
      Hardware: All operating systems at the current can run it. Not require a high-tech to use the website.</p>

    <h4>Skills</h4>
    <p>There is no special hardware needed to run this website.
      Need high experience in HTML, JavaScript, Machine Learning and Database.</p>

    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>This is a project that we really want to bring it to operate and not only used by RMIT students but also other
      universities. Although it might be challenging with first-year students. We are trying all best to have a
      prototype.
      Our ambition is not money, we just want to see it can contribute to making RMIT better.</p>

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Quang: I have some individual feedback for my teammates and myself:
        <ul>
          <li>Firstly, I think I need to improve my planning and set up a timetable. Some of the time I had too many
            works at
            the same time so I was late my group deadline.</li>
          <li>About Đức, he is an experienced programmer so the way he solves the deadline is very effective, he knows
            how to
            separate it and also enthusiasm in supporting us.</li>
          <li>About Minh, he is very energetic. He engages in every work and is not afraid to ask when he needs it.
            Because of
            that, we can easily help him when he needs it.</li>
          <li>About Vĩnh, he is a perfectionist like me so I understand how hard it is to try to make everything go on
            the
            trail. That is why sometimes he quite falls behind with the team. However, he still tries his best to
            overcome
            it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br><br>
      <li>Duc: I have some individual feedback for my teammates and myself:
        <ul>
          <li>I think I should be more clear in my communication (I talk too quietly) and push harder for what I think
            is
            better for our team (I think we should be more consistent with deadlines and commit our changes on GitHub
            more
            often).</li>
          <li>About Quang, his communication skill is excellent, and he is the one that gets our team to agree on a
            deadline
            and decide who do what.</li>
          <li>>About Minh, he is very engaging in our assignment, and is not afraid to ask for clarification or
            assistance,
            which is quite intimidating for me.</li>
          <li>About Vĩnh, it can be hard to reach him sometimes to discuss our assignment when we don't see each other
            after
            classes. However, I find his work is really well written and there is much to learn from him.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br><br>
      <li>Minh:
        <ul>
          <li>Đức: Help the team to have an organized path to deal with the project, keen on assisting the other members
            to
            try to finish their part on time for efficiency in time, take responsibility for hard parts of the project,
            quirks of a potential leader</li>

          <li>Quang: Finish his share of the project before stated schedule even though there were some personal
            activities
            must be done, help improve team’s enthusiasm as well gives encouragements, same as Đức (Show potential in
            leadership), did researches to help other teammates as well</li>
          <li>Vĩnh: Shows fair efficiency in working his own part, tends to boost morale of the group, help fixing
            grammars
            and vocabularies of others. Still, there were sometimes he tend to overwork as well as messed up his own
            schedule </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br><br>
      <li>Vinh:<ul>
          <li>Minh Duc: The techno-head of the group. He’s the one who talks least in the group, also a patient person.
            Although being quiet most of the time, he is approachable and enthusiastic at helping and supporting his
            teammates.</li>
          <li>Vinh Quang: He is active and approachable due to his extrovert personality. Always willing to support his
            teammates whenever he has time and find ways to cheer them up. He is also a mathematician of the team.</li>
          <li>Nhat Minh: About Minh, he has a great sense of humor. He is also good at critical thinking, which helps a
            lot for his teammates during the writing sessions. Despite not being available during the team’s meetings at
            times, he still tries his best for his contribution with the team whenever he has time.</li>
          <li>Hung Vinh: About myself, I would consider I’m kind of obtuse and usually mess up my team’s work for not
            finishing as soon as we expected. Nonetheless, I still try my very own best for not letting my team being
            late for the deadline of the assignment.</li>

    <h4>Group Reflections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Quang</b>: At the moment, we are quite slow with what we expect from the beginning. We are trying to make a
        prototype
        but we only have a plan and basic knowledge about HTML. We will try to focus on it and assignment 3 right after
        week 9. The surprise that came in when we were doing our project is everyone understands more about the IT
        world,
        knows deeper in some aspects like blockchains and cybersecurity. Not only have we learned the effective way to
        use
        and work with Github but we also try to learn and use markdown which is a very easy way to do HTML. Github has
        contributed to use of a perfect online workplace by using branches. Everyone can work and comment on other
        works.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Duc</b>: I agree with Quang that we are currently behind our schedule to make a prototype for our final
        project. Since
        I was the only member of the team that took Web Programming last semester, we have a lot to work on as a team to
        make a working prototype. We will focus on the prototype when assignment 2 is done. At the moment, we only
        finished planning our project, about what features it may have, what we need to do, who handles which part of
        the
        prototype, ... so no surprise happened yet. However, I do expect a lot more to happen when we put all of our
        effort on the project.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Minh</b>: Overall, as a team, I see that we are working at a stable flow and manage to finish the project
        before the
        deadline. To see that there are some major fallbacks and disadvantages to make the project a reality.
        Nevertheless, I have hopes in our team to overcome those barriers and reach the final goal.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Vinh</b>: Based on my own perspective, we get along well with each other. We try our best for not letting
        anyone fall behind too far. Even though I messed up my team’s work regularly, they still find ways to support me
        to solve the problems and pave me the way to finish my work effectively. </li>
